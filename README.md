My work for the capstone project of CodeCademy Pro Intensive course "[Building Websites From Scratch](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/build-websites-from-scratch)" in which I've learned HTML5, CSS3, responsive design, accessibility, and Git. 

In this capstone project, students were asked to code the landing page for Colmar Academy, a fictious school just newly founded. The layout design was given in the design spec, but the choice of color and typefaces was up to students. 

The reviewer (a professional web developer) gave me the following comment: "You went so far above and beyond, I am very impressed. It looks great and is very responsive. One thing that really stood out to me was how well organized and commented the CSS was. It made it really easy to understand and evaluate. Great job going above and beyond making this website accessible with the aria attributes and descriptive alt tags."
